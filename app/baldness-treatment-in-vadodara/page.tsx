    introContent: `Hair thinning and loss affect millions of people, yet most suffer in silence or waste money on products that don't work. If you're searching for baldness treatment, you need to understand that effective treatment starts with proper diagnosis.

Hair loss has multiple potential causes — genetics, hormones, nutritional deficiencies, stress, medical conditions, and even certain medications. Each cause requires a different treatment approach. That's why our dermatologists at Prime One Hair & Skin Clinic begin with comprehensive diagnostics including trichoscopy, blood work, and scalp analysis.

Our treatment protocols combine multiple evidence-based approaches for the best results. Depending on your diagnosis, this might include medical therapy, PRP or GFC treatments, low-level laser therapy, nutritional supplementation, and lifestyle modifications. We track progress through regular follow-ups and digital photography so you can see measurable improvement.`,
