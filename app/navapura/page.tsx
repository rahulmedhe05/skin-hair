    introContent: `Navapura lies in the historic heart of Vadodara — where the city's traditions run deepest and community connections are strongest. Our clinic serves this vibrant area with healthcare that respects its character.

The old city has unique characteristics — denser living, older buildings, traditional lifestyles. These affect skin and hair in specific ways. We understand these nuances and address them in our treatment approach.

Our patients here value authenticity over flash. They want doctors who know what they're doing, charge fairly, and treat people with respect. That's exactly what we deliver.`,
