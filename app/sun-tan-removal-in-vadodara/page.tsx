    introContent: `Uneven skin tone and pigmentation issues are among the most common concerns we see at our Vadodara clinic. Sun Tan Removal requires both expertise and patience — there are no instant fixes, but with the right approach, significant improvement is absolutely achievable.

Pigmentation develops through complex biological processes involving melanin production, sun exposure, hormonal changes, inflammation, and genetic factors. Different types of pigmentation — melasma, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, sun spots, and others — require different treatment strategies. That's why proper diagnosis is the essential first step.

Our pigmentation protocols at Prime One Hair & Skin Clinic combine multiple modalities for comprehensive results. This typically includes medical-grade topical treatments, chemical peels customized to your skin type, laser or light-based therapies, and strict sun protection guidance. We also address internal factors through nutritional recommendations and hormonal assessment when relevant.`,
