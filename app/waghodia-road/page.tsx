    introContent: `Waghodia Road — the stretch that connects MSU to Gotri and beyond — is home to students, academics, young professionals, and families. It's a vibrant corridor with diverse dermatological needs.

Our clinic caters to this diversity. University students with acne, professors dealing with stress-related hair fall, young couples preparing for weddings, families managing everyday skin issues — we see them all.

Being near the university brings its own charm. Young energy, curious questions, a willingness to try new treatments. But we balance that enthusiasm with medical prudence. Just because something is trendy doesn't mean it's right for you.`,
